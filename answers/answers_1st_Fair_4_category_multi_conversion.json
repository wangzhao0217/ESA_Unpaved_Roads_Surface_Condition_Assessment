The color uniformity of the road is not very clear, as there are black areas surrounding the road surface. These black areas are not part of the road surface and should be ignored when assessing the road's condition. The road surface itself appears to be relatively smooth, with no significant defects visible in the image.", "answer_id": "UtquLmH3z3rsMwgD2cAxrg", "model_id": "ESA_llava_VLM_4_category_multi_conversion", "metadata": {}}
